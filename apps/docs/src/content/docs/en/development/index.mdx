## Before you start

### Git

Make sure you've been added to the github repository and have push permission.

The main branch should be protected, so you'll need to work on another branch and
[open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
when your work is ready.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have all the dependencies, using the correct version:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download): currenly version 22, more generally the latest LTS.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation): currently on version 10, more generally the latest stable version.
  Should be specified in the root `package.json`.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): currently on version 17. Can be running from a Docker container.

<details>
    <summary>PostgreSQL Docker compose</summary>

    Run this compose file with `docker compose up -d` to get a Postgres database running.

    <Code code={dockerComposePostgres} lang="yaml" title="docker-compose.yaml" />

</details>

## Get the repo

Make sure to have [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) set up with git.
It makes using git much more convenient and [more secure](https://superuser.com/questions/1526712/why-is-ssh-safer-than-https-on-direct-connections-to-a-git-repository-with-crede).

You can also configure git to [sign your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits),
although not required.


<Steps>
1.  First off, clone the repo:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:finxol/karr.git
    ```

2.  Go into the directory and install the dependencies.

    ```sh
    cd karr
    pnpm install
    ```
</Steps>

### Git hooks

The repo uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage git hooks.

If a hook fails, the action won't take effect, leaving you the chance to fix it.

There are 3 hooks set up:

- **Pre-commit**: Format the staged files
- **Pre-push**: Run all tests, check types, lint, and check formatting. These are slower so only done before pushing.
- **Commit-msg**: Check the commit message follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  This commit format is useful for precise changelog generation.

The hook scripts are located in `.husky/`.

You can always deactivate the git hooks if you really don't like them, the checks will also be run in Github CI.
The hooks are there for a quicker feedback loop, and avoid waiting several minutes before finding out a check fails.
